    "In computer programming, type systems are syntactic methods to enforce and/or identify levels of abstraction. This means that type systems take advantage of the syntax of a particular programming language, in order to enforce rules and identify types. This is important, as it can manage abstraction in data, by ensuring that differing data types interact meaningfully with one another. An entire field in computer science has been dedicated to the study of programming languages from a type--theoretic approach. This is primarily due to the implication of types and their underlying principles in such areas in software engineering as optimisation and security.

The inner scopes *from* which a variable is referenced must themselves be contained within the defining scope --- e.g. in ```FuncB``` of Figure [Variable scopes](#fig:opts:scopes), we can reference ```a```, ```b```, and ```x```; but not ```f1```. This is because the scope of ```f1``` is ```Script``` <kbd>→</kbd> ```FuncA```, so it can only be referenced from ```Script```  <kbd>→</kbd> ```FuncA``` <kbd>→ ...</kbd>, but not  ````Script```<kbd>→  ...</kbd> or ```Script``` <kbd>→</kbd>  ```FuncB``` <kbd>→ ...</kbd>.\n",

This means that the Python interpreter goes through the codes that we write line by line, interpreting it to machine language. It is only then that the commands are processed and executed by the computer. On that account, a variable (or a function) can be referenced only *after* its initial definition. That is why, for instance, in ```Script (part 2)``` of Figure [Variable scopes](#fig:opts:scopes), we can reference every variable and function except for ```FuncC```, which is declared further down in the code hierarchy.\n",
